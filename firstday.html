        <h1> Casey: Nothing Is As Easy As It Seems </h1>
        <p> I am a runner. My thighs are strong. My endurance is strong. My arms are like two noodles and my arm muscles were not existent. I also had one ab. Just one. I know that might sound weird, but I really just had one. I walked into the class not really realizing how painful it would be. I thought we were going to look at the pole and maybe even poke it, but definitely not spin and climb. We took the crazy early 9:30 am class where they taught us how to touch a pole, not panic, and what to do when it gets slippery. I was like ohhhkay, I can totally do this! This will be easy. 
        <br>
        <br> Turns out that was the introduction to the class since it was our first time. Amongst the first things we learned were aerial squats, spins, and climbing. Aerial squats involved us pulling ourselves up onto the pole with our shoulders, locking our ankles around the pole, sitting with our thighs hugging the pole, and while holding the pole, straighten our body, standing around the pole and then falling back to a sit. If you can’t imagine this, picture doing squats while holding on a pole. Then, we learned how to do a sit spin where you kick your outside leg out (for momentum) and then you hold onto the pole with your inside hand and spin around the pole. As soon as you take off, you close your legs and bend them like you’re sitting in a chair. Finally, the topper, we learned to climb a 12 foot pole all the way to the top. Yeah, it’s crazy hard. You have to essentially koala the pole, straighten up and reach for higher up on the pole, and then bring your thighs up with you. It’s really hard. I definitely could not do it on the first day. It wasn’t until the second class that I made it all the way to the top. After the first day, I couldn’t stop shaking because I was in a lot of pain. My shoulders burned, my legs were bruised, my stomach felt tight, and every muscle in the body felt like it was about to fall off. 
        <br>
        <br>The day after the second day was much worse. It took me 3 tries in 5 minutes to get out of bed because my abs were so sore they wanted nothing to do with the moving process. It was even difficult to get dressed because my shoulders were pissed off at what I had put them through. But it was so worth it. I felt kind of beautiful, strong, athletic and excited for the rest of the classes. Meanwhile, my arms started bulging (seriously my arms look ripped now and I was complimented on my shoulders today!) </p>
