        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <p> We are a group of Olin College Engineering Students, who were interested in taking Pole-Dancing Fitness Classes for a passionate pursuit. There's a lot of taboo about Pole-Dancing, even though it is a form of eercise that takes strength, flexibility and endurance. It has also been shown to inspire body confidence, so we were interested in understanding the experience, difficulty and empowerment that comes along with this form of dance. </p>

        <h1> Our Experience </h1>
        <p> We are four engineering students that had remained largely within our Olin bubble until we made this decidion. Most of us came from conservative backgrounds, so explaining our intent to our families and friends was difficult to articulate. Part of the obstacle was the negative social stigma surrounding pole dancing. Although aerial silks have positive connotations with circus arts and fitness, pole dancing is normally seen under the provocative light of strip clubs. We were off to a rocky start when Groupon's posted address led us to a stranger's door. When we finally got to the correct location, we began a very unique and special experience. After the first few lifts and spins, we realized how difficult pole-dancing really was, as a sport and as an art. For many of us, we didn't have a lot of upper-body strength, and this whole experience has really helped all of us gain not only strength, but also confidence in our bodies. Every climb, every twist and every spin ended with sweat, bruises and cheers. We end every class saying "We did it! That was awesome!" Never did we get the sense that what we were doing was erotic, but rather we felt beautiful and strong. Most importantly, our friendships with each other and our classmates strengthened with every class. </p>
