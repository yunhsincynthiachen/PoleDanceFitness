        <h1> Casey: Impressions and Siddhartan </h1>
            <h3> Hi all, </h3>

            <p> My name is Casey and I am sophomore at Olin College studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my free time, I enjoy dancing, acting, each cheese (I am a Gouda girl), hanging out with my wonderful friends, and watching Gilmore Girls. When my friend, Cynthia, proposed that we do a Passionate Pursuit in Pole Dancing, I raised an eyebrow and I was like “ummmm….sure.” Honestly, I was expecting her not to follow through and lead the way. This is what happens for most Olin plans; plans are made and then people realize they are too stressed to do anything fun and fall through with fun plans. Therefore, you can imagine how surprised I was when Cynthia sent me a meeting request to plan for pole dancing. I stared at the iCal and contemplated with the response for a while. </p>

            <h4> These were my impressions of ladies that pole danced: </h4>

            <div id="orig_imag">
              <img src="caseyimpressions.jpg">
              <p>Ladies at strip clubs that swung around a pole, but mainly stripped for dollar bills. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="orig_imag">
              <img src="caseyimpressions2.jpg">
              <p>Ladies that were super flexible and bendable in ways that I definitely could not do. </p>
            </div>

            <h4> Something that was totally not me. </h4>

             <p> When I found out that this passionate pursuit was going to be on my transcript, I freaked out even more. Scholarships and future employers would see this and at the very minimum raise an eyebrow. My parents would also likely see my transcript and goodness the yell my mom would holler when she found out since my mom’s views are very similar to my own. When I was younger, I did many types of dance: ballet, Hip Hop, Contemporary, and Musicals. But NEVER POLE DANCING. This was not something I even thought about. I only saw sexy, stripper women pole dance on television. This could not be my life.

             <br>
             <br> I think what changed my mind the most was the next time I worked out. I tried to make it a point to work out every Friday night before fun, adult activities started. I went to one of the small gyms on campus and did my normal routine. 2 miles on the treadmill, 20 ab pull ups, 15 rows on the rower, and around 20 weight pull downs or whatever they are formally called. Sorry if these are not the technical terms, I have never made it a point to look up the formal names. I ran 2 miles easy because I love running. Halfway through the ab pull ups, I realized that I was bored because I had been staring at myself in the mirror through this entire workout. The only reason why I hate working out is because it’s not fun or interesting. I love running outside because it’s usually beautiful and I have always loved running. But my arms were limpy. Like noodles. Then, it hit me that pole dancing would be a great workout with awesome friends, it would be interesting, and it would get me back into the art of dancing. Pole dancing was not about stripping; pole dancing had to be an art form. In all of the pictures, pole dancers looked buff and strong. There had to be some serious muscles to hold yourself or swing around a pole.  I thought about pole dancing on my transcript and I resolved that I would not want to work for a company that does not let me be unique and reacts negatively to the concept of pole dancing.
             <br>
             <br> I emailed, a couple of days late, that I would join. The best reaction I have gotten to pole dancing came from my academic adviser. We were applying for money from the school to let us explore pole dancing as a passionate pursuit. A student’s academic adviser needs to sign the passionate pursuit form. I scheduled a meeting with my adviser, a man in his late 40s who lived in India until he got accepted into MIT for undergraduate college.  I walked into his office and had the paper in my hand. He seemed busy, so I knew that if I just flipped the page to the signature page then he would sign it and return it without flipping it to see the title. I almost got away with it, too! As he handed me back my passionate pursuit, he said “So what are you doing a passionate pursuit in?” I grimaced while responding, “pole dancing.” Before I finished the phrase, he began to say “Okay.” He only got through “Oh” before his brain realized what I had said. We looked at each other awkwardly for what felt like a long time. Then he said “okay, have fun?” in a questioning voice. I turned around and ran away as fast as possible.
             <br>
             <br> Later, I started to think about why this was so awkward? It was because pole dancing had a negative stigma as strippers. Why? What could I do to change this negative stigma? </p>

        <h1> Mika: Redefining the Art </h1>
          <p> Before my experience pole dancing this semester, I had never seen somebody pole dance, nor had I really put much thought into what it was like. My impressions on it were solely through the connotation of stripping, which automatically gave it certain implications for me. Pole dancers were taken advantage of. Pole dancers had low self-respect. Pole dancers were short of money. Although some of these labels may stand true in cases, thoughts like this blocked my understanding of the industry and the sport, and were integrated into conversations that I had with friends when we’d pass a strip club or a seductive billboard. This being said, I really didn’t feel strongly about pole dancing. I knew that I didn’t have much information to go off of, aside from what people had told me. I wanted to try the sport. I had heard of people taking classes, and it sounded like a perfect way to push aside these assumptions and challenge myself both mentally and physically.
          <br>
          <br> As we signed up for the class and discussed our pursuit with our advisors and other students, my anticipation grew. I was excited for the workout. I was excited for how it would change my mind. I was excited every time I got the chance to tell somebody what we were doing. It was amazing to see the stigma time and time again through the reactions I would get. There were people who said, “Wow, that’s awesome! I want to do that!” There were blushes from people who didn’t know how to respond. There was even a person who told me, “No, don’t do that!” (That one was the most shocking to me, especially as this was somebody whom I barely knew).
          <br>
          <br> After having taken several classes, I cannot believe how much we have grown. Pole dancing requires so much more than just getting past the negative stigma. You need the upper body strength to lift and carry your entire body through holds and spins. And many of the holds take an unbelievable amount of perseverance to fight through the deep, pinching, burning pain that comes with gripping the pole between your thighs. And then with all of the physical discomfort and stamina, it is a dance. So you have to keep your chin up and land gracefully, and when you end up falling on your butt you need to stand up with poise – something that I apparently do not possess. So now I have developed a great respect for pole dancers. I watch videos and get excited when I see moves I have learned in class, and appreciate the ones I cannot even imagine trying. I have expanded my definition of pole dancing far greater than I had intended, and I can’t wait to tell more people what I have learned. Pole dancers are powerful. Pole dancers are dedicated. Pole dancers are underestimated. We can change that. </p>

        <h1> Jenny: Why does pole fitness distance itself from burlesque and sexual dancing? </h1>
          <p> Whenever I mention pole dancing to our friends, family, and acquaintances, there a moment of tension before I qualify with “Don’t worry, it’s an exercise class.” After those words come out, they breathe this sigh of relief and suddenly the person is interested in a respectful way. “Alright, that’s okay then; I’ve heard it is great exercise. How’s it been going?”
          <br>
          <br> Now, we obviously were taking an exercise class, so clarifying this fact makes sense for communicating our experience. However, why should there be a moment of tension? When they say that my experience with pole dancing is alright, that naturally makes a distinction that some uses of pole dancing are right and some are not. Personally, I feel uncomfortable using my enjoyment and exercise as a way to further stigmatize strippers and other sex workers. That’s just not my brand of feminism.
          <br>
          <br> Turns out, I’m not alone in my discomfort with certain reactions to pole fitness. There is a tension between pole fitness and pole dancing as stripping. There is an argument that by running studios which sell the sexual connotation behind pole dancing to middle-class women who wouldn’t need to work it professionally, pole fitness instructors are only further stigmatizing stripping. http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/strippers-pole-dancers-sex-work-debate/ In particular contention is the marketing material behind competitions and fitness studio, most of which feature sexualized silhouettes in stilettos. (Yes, our site too.)
          <br>
          <br> Personally, I’m not certain where I stand on this issue. Clearly, I am viewing it from the side of pole fitness, and I would hate to be a hypocrite for finding a form of exercise which I enjoy. However, I think that there is some truth to the distinction further stigmatizing woman. I do not necessarily hold individual pole fitness instructors accountable for this tension. Every instructor at my studio has always been perfectly respectful, kind, and open-minded in my experience.
          <br>
          <br> Anyways, here is a link to a professional pole dancer’s blog. https://gstringsandinfamy.wordpress.com/ Her experience is pretty compelling, so I would definitely recommend reading. In her words, “Stripping is a great job for a lot of reasons, but it’s especially good for women with who don’t have a lot of social capital, no connections or degrees to pry open the higher wage jobs, women without the resources even to begin to access that social capital.  It’s good for women with kids because of the flexible hours and short shifts with a higher return than minimum wage–especially if she works night shifts when kids can be left with friends or family instead of paying for a babysitter…And it’s good for women like me:  I started off a teenage high school drop-out with no skills, who wanted enough money to pay rent and bills in an environment where I wouldn’t get in trouble for reading books when it got slow.”
          <br>
          <br> Though pole fitness is exercise for me, some women use pole dancing to support themselves and the people they care about. Working with whatever skill set you have to pay rent should always be an honorable situation. So, next time I tell you that I am pole dancing, don’t wait for me to qualify it. I shouldn’t need to clarify in order to earn your respect.
