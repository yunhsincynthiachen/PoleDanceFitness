        <h1> Casey: Impressions and Siddhartan </h1>
            <h3> Hi all, </h3>

            <p> My name is Casey and I am sophomore at Olin College studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my free time, I enjoy dancing, acting, each cheese (I am a Gouda girl), hanging out with my wonderful friends, and watching Gilmore Girls. When my friend, Cynthia, proposed that we do a Passionate Pursuit in Pole Dancing, I raised an eyebrow and I was like “ummmm….sure.” Honestly, I was expecting her not to follow through and lead the way. This is what happens for most Olin plans; plans are made and then people realize they are too stressed to do anything fun and fall through with fun plans. Therefore, you can imagine how surprised I was when Cynthia sent me a meeting request to plan for pole dancing. I stared at the iCal and contemplated with the response for a while. </p>

            <h4> These were my impressions of ladies that pole danced: </h4>

            <div id="orig_imag">
              <img src="caseyimpressions.jpg">
              <p>Ladies at strip clubs that swung around a pole, but mainly stripped for dollar bills. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="orig_imag">
              <img src="caseyimpressions2.jpg">
              <p>Ladies that were super flexible and bendable in ways that I definitely could not do. </p>
            </div>

            <h4> Something that was totally not me. </h4>

             <p> When I found out that this passionate pursuit was going to be on my transcript, I freaked out even more. Scholarships and future employers would see this and at the very minimum raise an eyebrow. My parents would also likely see my transcript and goodness the yell my mom would holler when she found out since my mom’s views are very similar to my own. When I was younger, I did many types of dance: ballet, Hip Hop, Contemporary, and Musicals. But NEVER POLE DANCING. This was not something I even thought about. I only saw sexy, stripper women pole dance on television. This could not be my life.

             <br>
             <br> I think what changed my mind the most was the next time I worked out. I tried to make it a point to work out every Friday night before fun, adult activities started. I went to one of the small gyms on campus and did my normal routine. 2 miles on the treadmill, 20 ab pull ups, 15 rows on the rower, and around 20 weight pull downs or whatever they are formally called. Sorry if these are not the technical terms, I have never made it a point to look up the formal names. I ran 2 miles easy because I love running. Halfway through the ab pull ups, I realized that I was bored because I had been staring at myself in the mirror through this entire workout. The only reason why I hate working out is because it’s not fun or interesting. I love running outside because it’s usually beautiful and I have always loved running. But my arms were limpy. Like noodles. Then, it hit me that pole dancing would be a great workout with awesome friends, it would be interesting, and it would get me back into the art of dancing. Pole dancing was not about stripping; pole dancing had to be an art form. In all of the pictures, pole dancers looked buff and strong. There had to be some serious muscles to hold yourself or swing around a pole.  I thought about pole dancing on my transcript and I resolved that I would not want to work for a company that does not let me be unique and reacts negatively to the concept of pole dancing.
             <br>
             <br> I emailed, a couple of days late, that I would join. The best reaction I have gotten to pole dancing came from my academic adviser. We were applying for money from the school to let us explore pole dancing as a passionate pursuit. A student’s academic adviser needs to sign the passionate pursuit form. I scheduled a meeting with my adviser, a man in his late 40s who lived in India until he got accepted into MIT for undergraduate college.  I walked into his office and had the paper in my hand. He seemed busy, so I knew that if I just flipped the page to the signature page then he would sign it and return it without flipping it to see the title. I almost got away with it, too! As he handed me back my passionate pursuit, he said “So what are you doing a passionate pursuit in?” I grimaced while responding, “pole dancing.” Before I finished the phrase, he began to say “Okay.” He only got through “Oh” before his brain realized what I had said. We looked at each other awkwardly for what felt like a long time. Then he said “okay, have fun?” in a questioning voice. I turned around and ran away as fast as possible.
             <br>
             <br> Later, I started to think about why this was so awkward? It was because pole dancing had a negative stigma as strippers. Why? What could I do to change this negative stigma? </p>
