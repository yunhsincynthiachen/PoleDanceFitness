        <h1> Mika: “POLE DANCING??!???!” </h1>

        <p> I was on the phone with my dad after one of our first classes, and feeling really excited about how good and strong it had made me feel. I have a very open relationship with my parents and decided that this was a good time to let them know what I was up to.
        <br>
        <br> “So there’s this thing I’ve been doing that you’re going to disapprove of.” 
        <br>
        <br> “Haha okay, what is it?” (I guess this didn’t seem out of the ordinary for me.)
        <br>
        <br> “I’m taking pole dancing lessons.”
        <br>
        <br> “POLE DANCING??!???!”
        <br>
        <br> “Yupp.” 
        <br>
        <br> “Okay…" 
        <br>
        <br> He paused for a while. This was clearly an awkward conversation for him to have with his daughter, and I think he was taking a moment to be open-minded about it. 
        <br>
        <br> "… Um… okay…. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I’m really at a loss for words.”
        <br>
        <br> After we shrugged that news off and finished talking, he handed the phone to my mom. 
        <br>
        <br> “Dad said you have something to tell me?” 
        <br>
        <br> “Yeah. I’m doing a Passionate Pursuit in pole dancing. We’re looking into the fitness and stigma surrounding the dance…” 
        <br>
        <br> “What?? Wait, really? No. No no no no no no no. What? No. No. Really??” 
        <br>
        <br> After the shock died down a little bit, I clarified to her that the classes we were taking were exercise classes; we were not learning how to strip. This was a bit of a relief for her, or would at least help her get through this. </p>
