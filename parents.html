        <h1> Mika: “POLE DANCING??!???!” </h1>

        <p> I was on the phone with my dad after one of our first classes, and feeling really excited about how good and strong it had made me feel. I have a very open relationship with my parents and decided that this was a good time to let them know what I was up to.
        <br>
        <br> “So there’s this thing I’ve been doing that you’re going to disapprove of.” 
        <br>
        <br> “Haha okay, what is it?” (I guess this didn’t seem out of the ordinary for me.)
        <br>
        <br> “I’m taking pole dancing lessons.”
        <br>
        <br> “POLE DANCING??!???!”
        <br>
        <br> “Yupp.” 
        <br>
        <br> “Okay…" 
        <br>
        <br> He paused for a while. This was clearly an awkward conversation for him to have with his daughter, and I think he was taking a moment to be open-minded about it. 
        <br>
        <br> "… Um… okay…. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I’m really at a loss for words.”
        <br>
        <br> After we shrugged that news off and finished talking, he handed the phone to my mom. 
        <br>
        <br> “Dad said you have something to tell me?” 
        <br>
        <br> “Yeah. I’m doing a Passionate Pursuit in pole dancing. We’re looking into the fitness and stigma surrounding the dance…” 
        <br>
        <br> “What?? Wait, really? No. No no no no no no no. What? No. No. Really??” 
        <br>
        <br> After the shock died down a little bit, I clarified to her that the classes we were taking were exercise classes; we were not learning how to strip. This was a bit of a relief for her, or would at least help her get through this. </p>

        <h1> Casey:  </h1>

        <p> I told them casually…over a text message because to be honest, I was kind of worries about how they would react to me pole dancing. I texted them at 8am (I know, wake up time was crazy early!) on the way to LOVE POLE fitness. They texted me back around noon asking what I was doing awake that early because I am definitely not a morning person. I told them I was taking a dance class and they were like what? What kind? That’s new! I drafted a really long text telling them other things that were new in my life and included “pole dancing” somewhere in there. The next time I talked to them on the phone, they asked me what was new in my life and I told them. My dad was kind of backed out of the conversation and my mom freaked out and made a reference about human trafficking. I know right, human trafficking? What? It’s taken a lot of time for her to kind of get used to the idea that I am not stripping and it’s a dance class. I tell her about it casually, but I know it’s not a topic that makes her happy. <p>

        <h1> Cynthia: </h1>

        <p> My parents are unpredictable people. They get mad at me for forgetting to replace the tissue roll in the bathroom, getting the kitchen floor wet, staying out with friends too late, and sleeping past 11 am. However, when I told my mom that I would be taking pole-dancing classes, she was extremely excited. Instead of asking me why I would do this, she asked and said things like:
        <br> 
        <br> "When do you start? This will be really good for you!"
        <br>
        <br> "How much will this cost... You're doing this as a passionate pursuit? Good! You need more exercise!"
        <br>
        <br> Stunned by my mom's reaction, I realized that she saw pole-dancing as a sport. She was open-minded that just because pole-dancing is mainly spun to be a provocative art form it doesn't mean that pole-dancing is a negative thing. Most importantly, she trusted that I knew what I was doing. Especially after talking to my friends about how their parents reacted, I realized how her perception of pole-dancing was very different from others. </p>
